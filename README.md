UF Phonebook Sync adapter for Android

Copyright 2010 Daniel Weisser, Martin Smith

Description/Summary:
 This work was based off of the LDAP Sync adapter for Android by Daniel Weisser (https://github.com/weisserd/LDAP-Sync). His work is available under the Apache 2.0 license (see doc/LICENSE). It also depends heavily on work done by UF WebAdmin (dwc, spoonstein, bfloyd, etc) and various system architects (asr, ipm, ebs, etc). As always, work like this stands on the shoulders of giants. Please join me in thanking them for all of their original work.
 
How to use:
 I have designed this project to be a sync provider based off email addresses listed in the official UF Directory as exposed by ldap.ufl.edu. Add a new 'account,' and select "UF Phonebook Sync" for the type. Then, sit back & enjoy. If your contact's email address doesn't match with one in the directory, it won't be synced. I'm welcome to other *reasonable* suggestions of how this should work, especially if the mapping for new contacts can be 1-to-1.
